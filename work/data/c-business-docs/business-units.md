### Business Unit Specificities

**Volume-Based Production:**
Poultry vaccines are manufactured in very high volumes (millions of doses per batch) with automated filling lines. A single batch may serve multiple customer orders.

**Dose-Based Metrics:**
Unlike other BUs, Poultry tracks production in doses rather than units. One vial typically contains 500-5,000 doses, making unit-based tracking impractical.

**Mass Application Methods:**
Products designed for spray, drinking water, or in-ovo administration rather than individual animal injection. This influences formulation and packaging requirements.

**Cold Chain Critical:**
All vaccines require unbroken refrigerated cold chain (+2°C to +8°C) from manufacturing through administration.

**Hatchery Market:**
Significant portion of revenue from vaccines administered at hatcheries (day-old chicks), requiring just-in-time delivery and rapid shelf turnover.

**Seasonal Patterns:**
Production peaks in Q1-Q2 (Northern Hemisphere spring) for summer poultry production cycles. Southern Hemisphere markets follow opposite pattern.

**Regulatory Environment:**
Each country requires separate registration for poultry vaccines. Product variations by market based on local disease prevalence and regulatory requirements.

### Business Unit Specificities

**Diverse Therapeutic Classes:**
Unlike Poultry (vaccines only), Ruminants encompasses vaccines, antiparasitics, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatories. This requires diverse manufacturing capabilities and quality control expertise.

**Seasonal Demand Patterns:**
- Clostridial vaccines peak in spring (pre-turnout to pasture)
- Antiparasitics peak in spring/summer (grazing season)
- Respiratory vaccines peak in fall (housing period)
- Mastitis treatments have year-round demand with slight summer peak

**Unit-Based Measurement:**
Production measured in units (packages) rather than doses. Each unit typically treats one animal for one course of therapy.

**Veterinary Channel:**
Significant portion of sales through veterinary clinics requiring technical support and relationship management. Veterinarians influence product selection.

**Withdrawal Periods:**
Many products have meat and milk withdrawal periods (time before animal products can enter food chain). This drives product selection and requires clear labeling.

**Large Animal Dosing:**
Products designed for large animals (cattle can weigh 600-800 kg). Injectable volumes are larger than companion animals.

**Farm-Level Application:**
Products designed for on-farm use by farmers and ranchers, not just veterinarians. Ease of administration is critical.

**Registration Complexity:**
Multi-species registrations (bovine, ovine, caprine) with different dosing regimens. Each species may require separate clinical trials.

### Business Unit Specificities

**Veterinary-Exclusive Channel:**
Most products sold exclusively through veterinary clinics, requiring strong veterinary relationship management and technical support.

**Pet Owner Decision Making:**
Ultimate customer is pet owner, not veterinarian. Marketing focuses on pet owner education while supporting veterinary recommendations.

**High SKU Count:**
Extensive product variations:
- Multiple weight ranges (small, medium, large dogs)
- Species variations (dog vs cat)
- Multiple pack sizes (1-dose, 3-dose, 6-dose, 12-dose)
This creates manufacturing complexity despite similar formulations.

**Unit-Based Measurement:**
Production tracked in units where each unit represents treatment for one animal (one month of flea/tick protection, one vaccination, etc.).

**Premium Packaging:**
Consumer-facing packaging with high aesthetic standards. Compliance with varied global labeling regulations.

**No Food Safety Concerns:**
Unlike production animals, no withdrawal periods or food safety considerations. This simplifies regulatory burden but increases focus on pet safety.

**Preventive Care Focus:**
Products designed for ongoing prevention rather than acute treatment. This drives subscription models and repeat purchases.

**Spot-On Technology:**
Significant expertise in small-volume topical applications with dermal distribution. Requires specialized formulation and packaging equipment.

**Distributed Manufacturing:**
Unlike centralized Poultry or Ruminants production, Companion products may be manufactured at contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) in addition to owned sites. This explains some NULL values in site_fk data.

**Seasonal Variation:**
Antiparasitic demand peaks in spring/summer (flea and tick season), while vaccines maintain steadier year-round demand.

**Direct-to-Consumer Trend:**
Growing e-commerce channel for certain products, though prescription products remain veterinary-exclusive.

**Pet Humanization:**
Owners increasingly view pets as family members, willing to invest in preventive care, premium products, and innovative solutions.
