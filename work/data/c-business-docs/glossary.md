# Business Glossary

## Batch and Lot Terminology

### Batch
A specific quantity of a pharmaceutical product manufactured in a single production cycle under uniform conditions. Each batch is assigned a unique identifier for traceability purposes.

### Lot
Synonymous with batch in pharmaceutical manufacturing. A lot represents a homogeneous quantity of product produced during one production cycle.

### Batch Number
Unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to each manufactured batch. Format varies by Business Unit (see Business Rules documentation).

### Production Date
The date when manufacturing of the batch was initiated or completed, depending on internal procedures.

### Expiry Date
The date after which the product should not be used, calculated based on stability studies and regulatory requirements.

## Quality Control Statuses

### Released
Batch has passed all QC tests and regulatory requirements. Approved for commercial distribution and use.

### Pending
Batch is awaiting initial QC testing or test results. No quality determination has been made yet.

### Rejected
Batch has failed QC testing or does not meet specifications. Cannot be released for commercial use and must be destroyed or reprocessed.

### Quarantine
Batch is on hold pending investigation, additional testing, or management decision. Cannot be distributed until status changes.

### In Production
Batch is currently being manufactured. QC testing has not yet commenced.

### QC Testing
Batch manufacturing is complete and quality control testing is actively underway.

## GMP Deviation

### Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Deviation
An unplanned departure from established manufacturing procedures, specifications, or quality standards during production. Deviations must be documented, investigated, and assessed for impact on product quality.

### Deviation Impact
GMP deviations are classified by severity:
- **Critical**: Likely to affect product quality, safety, or efficacy
- **Major**: May affect product quality but unlikely to reach the patient
- **Minor**: Procedural deviation with no quality impact

### CAPA
Corrective and Preventive Action. The systematic process to investigate deviation root causes and implement measures to prevent recurrence.

## Therapeutic Classes

### Vaccine
Biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious disease. Contains antigens that stimulate the immune system.

### Antiparasitic
Pharmaceutical product that treats or prevents parasitic infections (internal parasites like worms or external parasites like ticks and fleas).

### Antibiotic
Antimicrobial substance active against bacterial infections. Used therapeutically to treat bacterial diseases in animals.

### Anti-inflammatory
Pharmaceutical product that reduces inflammation, pain, and fever. Commonly used in companion animals for pain management and chronic conditions.

## Pharmaceutical Forms

### Injectable
Sterile liquid preparation administered via injection (subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous). Requires strict sterility controls.

### Oral Solution
Liquid preparation for oral administration. Active ingredient is dissolved in a suitable solvent.

### Bolus
Large tablet or capsule designed for oral administration to ruminants. Typically provides sustained release of active ingredients.

### Pour-On
Topical liquid preparation applied along the back of the animal. Commonly used for antiparasitics in cattle.

### Tablet
Solid oral dosage form containing active ingredients compressed into a specific shape.

### Gel
Semi-solid preparation for oral or topical administration. Commonly used in companion animals.

### Powder
Dry particulate formulation, typically reconstituted before use or mixed with feed/water.

### Spot-On
Small volume liquid applied to a single spot on the animal's skin, typically between shoulder blades. Common antiparasitic form for companion animals.

## Cold Chain Requirements

### Cold Chain
Temperature-controlled supply chain required to maintain product efficacy from manufacturing through administration. Critical for vaccines and certain biological products.

### Storage Temperature Range
- **Frozen**: -25°C to -15°C
- **Refrigerated**: +2°C to +8°C
- **Room Temperature**: +15°C to +25°C

### Temperature Excursion
Deviation from required storage temperature range. Must be documented and assessed for impact on product stability.

### Cold Chain Break
Period where product temperature exceeds acceptable limits, potentially compromising product efficacy.

## Dose vs Unit Distinction

### Dose
A single administration unit for vaccination, typically used in poultry production. One vial may contain multiple doses (e.g., 1000 doses per vial for poultry vaccines).

### Unit
A single package or saleable item. Used for ruminant and companion animal products where each package represents one treatment or one saleable unit.

### Quantity Doses
Total number of individual animal treatments in a batch. Primarily applicable to poultry vaccines where mass vaccination occurs.

### Quantity Units
Total number of individual packages or saleable items in a batch. Standard measure for ruminant and companion animal products.
