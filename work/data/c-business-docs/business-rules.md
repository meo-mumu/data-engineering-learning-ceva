# Business Rules and Constraints

## QC Release Process

### Typical Release Timeline
The quality control release cycle typically spans 7-21 days from batch completion to release status, depending on product complexity and testing requirements.

**Timeline Breakdown:**
- Poultry vaccines: 7-14 days (faster due to standardized testing protocols)
- Ruminant biologicals: 14-21 days (includes sterility and potency testing)
- Companion animal products: 10-18 days (varies by formulation complexity)

### QC Testing Requirements
All batches must undergo the following tests before release:
- Identity testing (confirm active ingredient presence)
- Potency/assay testing (verify concentration meets specifications)
- Sterility testing (for injectables and vaccines)
- Endotoxin testing (for injectable products)
- Physical testing (appearance, pH, particulate matter)

### Approval Criteria
A batch receives "released" status only when:
- All QC test results meet or exceed specifications
- No critical or unresolved GMP deviations exist
- Manufacturing documentation is complete and approved
- Regulatory compliance is verified
- Quality Assurance department provides final approval signature

### Rejection Criteria
A batch must be rejected if:
- Any critical specification is not met
- Sterility test failure (no retest allowed)
- Critical GMP deviation with proven impact on quality
- Manufacturing error that cannot be adequately investigated
- Contamination detected

## Expiry Date Calculation Rules

### Rule by Product Type

**Vaccines (all Business Units):**
- Shelf life: 24 months from manufacturing date when stored at +2°C to +8°C
- Expiry date = Production date + 24 months

**Injectable Antibiotics:**
- Shelf life: 36 months from manufacturing date when stored at room temperature
- Expiry date = Production date + 36 months

**Antiparasitics (Pour-On, Spot-On):**
- Shelf life: 30 months from manufacturing date
- Expiry date = Production date + 30 months

**Oral Solutions:**
- Shelf life: 24 months from manufacturing date (unopened)
- Once opened: use within 28 days

**Tablets and Boluses:**
- Shelf life: 36-48 months depending on formulation
- Expiry date validated through stability studies

### Temperature Dependency
Products requiring refrigeration have reduced stability if stored at room temperature. Cold chain breaks exceeding 48 hours typically result in 50% reduction in remaining shelf life.

## GMP Deviation Management

### Deviation Threshold
All deviations from established procedures must be documented regardless of perceived severity. No minimum threshold exists for reporting.

### Severity Classification
**Critical Deviation:**
- Immediate notification to Quality Assurance and Production Management
- Batch automatically placed in quarantine status
- Full investigation required within 5 working days
- Senior management approval required for batch disposition

**Major Deviation:**
- Notification to Quality Assurance within 24 hours
- Batch may continue processing with QA oversight
- Investigation required within 10 working days
- QA Manager approval for batch release

**Minor Deviation:**
- Documentation required but no immediate escalation
- Investigation within 30 days
- QA review during routine batch release process

### Escalation Process
1. Deviation identified by production operator or QC analyst
2. Immediate verbal notification to line supervisor
3. Written deviation report submitted within 2 hours
4. Quality Assurance reviews and classifies severity within 4 hours
5. For critical deviations: Senior management briefing within 8 hours
6. Investigation team assigned based on severity
7. CAPA plan developed and approved
8. Implementation tracking until closure

### Impact on Batch Status
- Critical deviation: Batch remains in quarantine until full investigation concludes
- Major deviation: Batch can proceed with additional testing/monitoring
- Minor deviation: Typically no impact on batch processing timeline

## Storage Temperature Requirements

### By Product Category

**Vaccines:**
- Storage: +2°C to +8°C (refrigerated cold chain)
- Transport: Cold chain required at all times
- Maximum excursion: 2 hours at room temperature during administration
- Monitoring: Continuous temperature logging required

**Injectable Antibiotics:**
- Storage: +15°C to +25°C (room temperature)
- Protection from light and excessive heat required
- No cold chain requirement

**Antiparasitics:**
- Pour-on/Spot-on: +15°C to +25°C
- Protect from freezing (efficacy loss if frozen)
- Protect from direct sunlight

**Oral Solutions:**
- Storage: +15°C to +25°C
- Some formulations require refrigeration after opening
- Check product-specific requirements

**Tablets, Boluses, Powders:**
- Storage: +15°C to +25°C
- Humidity control critical (store in dry conditions)
- Moisture-proof packaging required

### Warehouse Zoning
Manufacturing sites maintain segregated storage areas:
- Zone A: Refrigerated storage (+2°C to +8°C) for vaccines
- Zone B: Room temperature controlled (+15°C to +25°C) for most products
- Zone C: Quarantine area for unreleased or under-investigation batches
- Zone D: Rejected material storage pending destruction

## Batch Numbering Conventions

### Poultry Business Unit
**Format:** POL-YYYY-XXXXX

**Structure:**
- POL = Business Unit identifier
- YYYY = 4-digit year of manufacture
- XXXXX = 5-digit sequential number (resets annually)

**Example:** POL-2024-00127 (127th poultry batch manufactured in 2024)

### Ruminants Business Unit
**Format:** RUM-YYYYMM-XXXX

**Structure:**
- RUM = Business Unit identifier
- YYYY = 4-digit year
- MM = 2-digit month
- XXXX = 4-digit sequential number (resets monthly)

**Example:** RUM-202403-0045 (45th ruminant batch manufactured in March 2024)

### Companion Animals Business Unit
**Format:** COMP-YYYY-XXXXX

**Structure:**
- COMP = Business Unit identifier (note: 4 characters)
- YYYY = 4-digit year of manufacture
- XXXXX = 5-digit sequential number (resets annually)

**Example:** COMP-2024-00892 (892nd companion animal batch manufactured in 2024)

### Site-Specific Suffixes
Some production sites append a location code:
- -LIB (Libourne, France)
- -BUD (Budapest, Hungary)
- -SUZ (Suzhou, China)
- -LEN (Lenexa, USA)
- -ALG (Algete, Spain)

**Example:** POL-2024-00127-LIB indicates a poultry batch from Libourne.

### Batch Number Assignment Rules
- Batch numbers are assigned at production initiation
- Numbers cannot be reused, even if batch is rejected
- Sequential order must be maintained for traceability
- Manual override of numbering requires Quality Assurance approval and deviation documentation
